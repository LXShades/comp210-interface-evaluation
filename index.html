          <h2>Introduction</h2>
			After four long, cold years of nobody playing Critical Critters, the powers that be have suddenly ordered that it is now in dire need of a use interface evaluation.<br>
			<br>
			The evaluation takes place in two stages: The Heuristic Evaluation and Supporting Evaluation. The Supporting Evaluation will likely be inspired by the results of the Heuristic evaluation.
			
		  <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
			The heuristic evaluation will be conducted with three university students on a computing and games-focused course. The game designer and experimenter will be monitoring but not commenting on the . These are all henceforth questionably  During the heuristic evaluation, the following heuristics will be addressed:
			
			Each heuristic will be assigned a severity rating of between 1 and 5. 1 is of minimal, but noteworthy concern whilst 5 is of high priority.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>After four long, cold years of nobody playing Critical Critters, the powers that be have suddenly ordered that it is now in dire need of a use interface evaluation, in what is almost certainly a well-meaning but obtuse denial of the marketing issue we have at stake. Such as no-one knowing the game exists.</p>
			<p>The evaluation takes place in two stages: The Heuristic Evaluation and Player Evaluation. The former is focused on expert opinions of the interface whilst the Player Evaluation focuses on the perspective of a player who hasn't played before.</p>
			<p>Goals of the evaluation include determining:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Which game mechanics work the most intuitively</li>
			<li>The learning curve of the game</li>
			<li>Character preferences of each player</li>
			<li>Feedback in response to player actions</li>
			<li>Impact of not having sound effects</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The evaluations are performed on a small sample of questionably-titled student experts and a set of questionably-titled student expert gamers, respectively.</p>
			<p>The results will be used to determine the changes to consider in a potential remake of the otherwise long-untouched game.</p>

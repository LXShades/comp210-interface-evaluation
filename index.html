          <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>After four long, cold years of nobody playing Critical Critters, the powers that be have suddenly ordered that it is now in dire need of an HCI evaluation, in what is almost certainly a well-meaning but obtuse denial of the marketing issue we have at stake. Such as no-one knowing the game exists.</p>
			<p>The evaluation takes place in two stages: The Heuristic Evaluation and Player Evaluation. The former is focused on expert opinions of the interface whilst the Player Evaluation focuses on the perspective of a player who hasn't played before.</p>
			<p>Goals of the evaluation include determining:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Which game mechanics work the most intuitively</li>
			<li>The learning curve of the game</li>
			<li>Character preferences of each player</li>
			<li>Feedback in response to player actions</li>
			<li>Impact of not having sound effects</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The evaluations are performed on a small sample of questionably-titled <i>student experts</i> and a set of questionably-titled <i>student expert gamers</i>, respectively.</p>
			<p>The results will be used to determine the changes to consider in a potential remake of the otherwise long-untouched game.</p>

		<h2>Critical Critters</h2>
		<p>Critical Critters is a multiplayer online third-person shooter featuring fluffy adorable animals as the player characters. Its key features include fast-paced characters, a colourful art style and chaotic nature. The stars of the game are the Static Bunny and Homing Pigeon, in fact the only two characters that survived the short development cycle. These two character have distinctive abilities and controls offering variety in gameplay approaches.</p>
		<p>One focus of the game is that it provides the player with a significant level of control, with high accessibility, simplicity, and skill ceilings. This requires a precise control scheme that is intuitive and flexible. The goal of the evaluation, other than to, perhaps, satisfy a hypothetical terrifying assignment brief with a tight deadline, is to determine the efficacy of these control schemes with regards to the overall player experience, noting the differences between the two playable characters.</p>

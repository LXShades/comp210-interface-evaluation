		<p>The evaluation on two small samples provided useful feedback for the game. Common praises included the fast-paced gameplay and ability to fly, although most players generally preferred playing as the bunny character, who could not fly. On the other hand, players expressed an interest in the pigeon were he designed perfectly. There was criticism of the lack of a tutorial and sound effects by the heuristic evaluators, while both groups criticised the difficulty aiming, perhaps due to the small characters. These have been noted for future consideration.</p>
		<p>In the short term, two immediate improvements were planned for the game. The first improvement is the addition of simple HUD-oriented tutorials such that new players can understand how it plays without needing to read a guide: this was based primarily on feedback from the heuristic evaluators stating that was no simple way for new players to understand the controls. The second improvement is a reduction on the respawn time of the homing pigeon to make him less frustrating: this was based primarily on feedback from the players, who expressed a dislike for the dying and respawn times. Improvements to the camera controls upon death will let players see how close or far they were, possibly helping them understand how to improve their aim for next next life.</p>
		<p>Both changes should be actionable within a couple of days or less.</p>
		<p>A future evaluation would focus on increasing the sample size - with particular interest in broadening its demographic beyond gamers - and fine-tuning some of the questions, with a particular interest in adding more questions whose answers can be compared with the characters.</p>

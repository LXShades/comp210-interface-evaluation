          <h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>After four long, cold years of nobody playing Critical Critters, the powers that be have suddenly ordered that it is now in dire need of a use interface evaluation, in what is almost certainly a well-meaning but obtuse denial of the marketing issue we have at stake. Such as no-one knowing it exists.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The evaluation takes place in two stages: The Heuristic Evaluation and Supporting Evaluation. The Supporting Evaluation will likely be inspired by the results of the Heuristic evaluation.</p>
			
		  <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
			<p>The heuristic evaluation will be conducted with three university students on a computing and games-focused course. The game designer, who doubles as the experimenter, will be monitoring them; but not commenting unless asked. These participants are all henceforth questionably entitled 'the experts'. During the heuristic evaluation, the following heuristics will be commented on:</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li>Let's be hu-realistic about this, there is no list yet.</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Each heuristic will be assigned a severity rating of between 1 and 5. 1 is of minimal, but noteworthy concern whilst 5 is of high priority.</p>
			
			<h3>Design considerations</h3>
			<p>Here is discussed the rationale behind the heuristic choices. To begin with, these areas cover some of the core values to the <i>Critical Critters</i> experience:</p>
			
			<ul>
			<li>Fun chaotic feel</li>
			<li>Smooth, high-speed, and easy-to-learn controls</li>
			<li>Satisfying hit effects</li>
			<li>Game is aesthetically pleasing</li>
			<li>Map is easy to navigate</li>
			<li>Death rainbows indicate the locations of surviving players (henceforth 'fresh meat')</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Partially deriving from this list, we can create a provisional list of questions of interest:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Demographic info such as age, gender</li>
			<li>Favourite two things about the game. Lay 'em on me</li>
			<li>Least favourite two things about the game. Lay 'em on me</li>
			<li>Speed of your character? (1: too slow 5: too fast 3: very satisfactory)</li>
			<li>Did you realise you can run on walls and ceilings?</li>
			<li>How challenging did you find wall-running? (1: piece of cake 3: uncertain about it 5: how do I know where I'm going)</li>
			<li>Did you realise you could charge your lightning up before firing?</li>
			<li>As the Homing Pigeon, how difficult did you find it to hit other players?</li>
			<li>How enjoyable did you find the Homing Pigeon experience?</li>
			<li>Which character did you enjoy more?</li>
			<li>Did you know you could ride rainbows?</li>
			<li>Did you know you could dash as the bunny?</li>
			<li>How was the meat</li>
			</ul>
			
			Some details can also be gleaned from the game including: the scores of each player.<br>
			
			<h3>Proposal</h3>
			<p>A hybrid approach is recommended for the evaluation. At least six participating users will play the game. With permission, their screens will be recoded in a screen-recording software such as <i>OBS</i> and analysed later to identify timestamps. The timestamps be used to derive the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Length of time spent playing as each character</li>
			<li>Average time alive and outside the base</li>
			<li>Number of kills, deaths, and deaths by the pit</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In this hypothetical scenario, the following timestamps will be used to convey certain information to the players:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><b>5 minutes:</b> Players are requested to switch to the pigeon character.</li>
			<li><b>10 minutes:</b> Players are informed that they may now switch between the two characters freely.</li>
			<li></li>
			</ul>
			<p>If a questionnaire were to be produced it should consider:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Were you aware of: bunny dash, 
			</ul>
			
			They're Pinky and the Brain,
			yes Pinky and the Brain;
			One is a genius
			the other's insane
			They're laboratory mice
			Their genes have been spliced
			
			They're dinky
			They're Pinky and the Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain Brain.....

		<h2>Player Evaluation</h2>
		<h3>Context</h3>
		<p>This evaluation was carried out on a small sample of players (N = 8) who had never played the game before in the studio at Falmouth University.</p>
		<h3>Character comparison</h3>
		<div style="text-align:center"><iframe width="527" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDNB7ushYH4_Ofcr1jcR3JpzWtAquF6U5OGpYDUz6CB8OViVdMZwsZH6G7ebx3hOMcWqJhdSlTWMvK/pubchart?oid=431515833&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></div>
		<span class="figure">Fig. 1: Player character experience</span>
		<p>The above are mean averages of a Likert scale depicting the players' opinions of four attributes of each character. Generally, the bunny character outperformed the pigeon character in most departments, noting that the first column is an inverted indicator of the player's quality of experience.</p>
		<h4>Frustration vs Control</h4>
		<p>One pitfall of the pigeon evidenced in Fig. 1 is an increased frustration with the character compared to the bunny. However, while the pigeon was reported to be easier to control, it was also reported to be significantly more frustrating to the player (Fig. 1). This could contradict an assumption that the frustration is due to difficult controls.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, despite the significantly higher reports of player frustration, the other attributes performed quite similarly between the pigeon and the bunny. That suggests that despite the allegedly more frustrating experience, the pigeon was still highly enjoyable to play.</p>

		<span class="figure">Fig. 2: Responses to open questions about the game. Pigeon-specific responses are <span style="color: aqua";>blue</span> whilst bunny-specific responses are <span style="color: yellow;">yellow.</span></span>
		<p>The reason for these paradoxes could be derived from the qualitative responses to the questionnaire's open question, asking <i>'What was your favourite part of the game?'</i>. The two pigeon-specific responses not only outweigh the single bunny-specific response, but both praise flying as an enjoyable ability. Given that this has been described as the favourite feature of the game, it is likely that the player's greater enjoyment of the Homing Pigeon stems from the excitement of being able to fly.</p>
		<p>This, combined with the description that the Homing Pigeon is easier to control, suggests that the controls are not responsible for the Homing Pigeon's lower performance in the mighty tall bar mountains of data justice.</p>
		<h4>Where is the frustration coming from?</h4>
		<p>An opposing open question in the questionnaire asked <i>'What was your least favourite part of the game?'</i>. The following responses were given:</p>
		<ul>
		</ul>
		<p>Before continuing, it is noted that the Homing Pigeon's primary means of attacking players is by crashing into them, with the pigeon exploding and dying in the process to fulfil its noble desTNTny. It is therefore worth noting the unfavourable reactions to: <b>dying</b>, <b>killing yourself as the bir[d]</b>, and <b>attacking</b>. It would stand to reason that although it is the destiny of the pigeon to explode on impact, this process of dying in a self-inflicted manner could be frustrating to players, especially if they feel that the <b>spawning time</b> is too high, or that it is <b>difficult to aim</b> and <b>hard to hit other players</b>.</p>
		<p>In the case of the Homing Pigeon, the main two challenges appear to be in <b>aiming</b> and <b>dying</b>. As exploding and dying is a fundamental part of the Homing Pigeon's noble destiny, the future development of the Homing Pigeon could instead dedicate toward improving the aiming process, and perhaps the spawn time. The heuristic evaluation could provide more insight on how the aiming process should be improved.</p>
		<h4>Afterthought</h4>
		<p>As the sample size is so small, a firm conclusion cannot be derived from this data. However, it serves as a useful initial indicator of possible problem areas of the game mechanics, particularly surrounding the pigeon.</p>
		<p>In a future survey, it would be more useful to separate the open questions between the character, so that it is clearer which elements of which characters were appreciated and disliked. Reliable interpretation of the above data, with regards to its impact on each character, is impossible due to this lack of clarity.</p>
		<p>It may also be useful to include the Likert scale for the following statement: <i>'I felt powerful as this character'</i>. This could help identify whether the source of frustration was indeed the player's ability to control the character, or perhaps the strength of the character's abilities, independent to how effectively the player can actually utilise them.</p>

		<h3>Character preferences</h3>
		<div style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDNB7ushYH4_Ofcr1jcR3JpzWtAquF6U5OGpYDUz6CB8OViVdMZwsZH6G7ebx3hOMcWqJhdSlTWMvK/pubchart?oid=1135978605&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></div>
		<p>The player's preferences for each character are roughly consistent with the findings in the previous section. Even the aesthetic of the bunny character was preferred. However, the pigeon performed more strongly in a hypothetical, idealised gameplay scenario wherein the character is designed perfectly. It is thus likely that, should the pigeon be easier to control, more powerful, or simply less frustrating, it could be an equally popular character. This creates a strong argument for improving this character in particular.</p>
		<h3>Bias in aesthetic</h3>
		<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDNB7ushYH4_Ofcr1jcR3JpzWtAquF6U5OGpYDUz6CB8OViVdMZwsZH6G7ebx3hOMcWqJhdSlTWMvK/pubchart?oid=2009854506&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<p>A question raised during the assessment of the results was whether the <i>aesthetic</i> of a character could influence the player's preferences for the <i>gameplay</i> of that character. As illustrated above, there seems to be no positive correlation between a player's preference for a character's aesthetics and their gameplay. In fact, amusingly, players who preferred the aesthetic design of the <i>Pigeon</i> (63%) actually preferred the <i>Bunny's</i> gameplay, and even then, they appeared to enjoy the overall experience less. Contrastingly, players who preferred the aesthetic of the <i>Bunny</i> enjoyed both characters more.</p>
		<p>The sample size is arguably too small to derive a definitive answer. However, one hypothesis is that those who enjoyed the aesthetics of the pigeon played it more. As reported above, the pigeon character was overall less enjoyable to play. Therefore, the correlation could be a result of recall bias created from the reduced overall enjoyability experienced by these players as a result of playing the pigeon more frequently. This may have influenced their responses to both characters.</p>
		<p>For further research, the video footage of the players could be analysed to find the playtime of each character by the respondents. If a link exists between the aesthetic preferences of a character and the time spent playing that character, this could add further plausibility to the above hypothesis.</p>

		<h3>Ideal number of players</h3>
		<p>To prevent potential insight bias caused by players, the quesionnaire did not ask the respondents what number of players they felt woul dbe ideal. Instead, to focus on finding a desire for more or less players, a Likert-style scale between 1 and 5 was added to let them express whether they wanted to see more or less players.</p>
		<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;"><img src="images/player_counts.png" alt="Player count preferences" width="300" /></div>
		<p>In the quesionnaire, 5 was described as "I want to see more players", whilst 1 was described as "I want to see less players".</p>
		<p>It is marginally possible that this question could be misinterpreted for an opinion on the overall popularity of the game. However, since the question, "How did you feel about the number of players?", was asked in past tense (indicating its applicability to the actual play session), this is unlikely.</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h3>Summary</h3>
		<p>The evaluation demonstrated that the Static Bunny character was generally preferred to the Homing Pigeon character in gameplay. The idea, however, is appreciated: were both characters designed perfectly, the preferences may be about the same. Potential flaws in the pigeon include difficulty aiming, struggling to see characters from long distances, and respawn time as a result of the kamikaze explosion. The Static Bunny's flaws included some difficulty controlling it while climbing walls. There is justification in improving the pigeon in these areas such that it can match the player's ideal perception.</p>
		<p>Overall, the feel of the game was praised for its fast pace and ability to fly.</p>

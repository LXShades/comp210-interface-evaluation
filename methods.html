		  <h3>Heuristic Evaluation</h3>
			<p>The heuristic evaluation will be conducted with three university students on a computing and games-focused course. The game designer, who doubles as the observer, will be monitoring them; but not commenting unless asked. These participants are all henceforth questionably entitled 'the experts'. During the heuristic evaluation, the following heuristics will be commented on:</p>
			<p>Each heuristic will be assigned a severity rating of between 1 and 5. 1 is of minimal, but noteworthy concern whilst 5 is of high priority.</p>
			<p>The heuristic evaluation will take place after the player evaluation (CONTINUE)</p>

			<h3>Player Evaluation</h3>
			<p>The player evaluation took the form of a recorded session followed immediately by a questionnaire. Players were introduced to the process with a document introducing them briefly to the controls. Some character controls and abilities were ommitted to test whether players would discover them without instruction.</p>
			
			<p>There were eight participants, creating a small but highly manageable sample appropriate for the short time scale available. There was no opposition to the recording of their screens with OBS, eliminating any selection bias between those who did or did not volunteer to record.</p>
			
			<p>During the process, the players were directed by the observer to do the following:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>0 minutes (start):</b> Half the players are requested to play the pigeon, and the other half to play the bunny.</li>
				<li><b>5 minutes:</b> Players were asked to switch their character, i.e. play as the opposite character for the next five minutes.</li>
				<li><b>10 minutes:</b> After equal time playing each character, players were explicitly permitted to play as either character for the remaining play time.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The players were deliberately divided into these two groups to a) enable a balanced mixture of flying and ground characters, and b) reduce potential recall bias, as players may be more or less likely to favour the last character they played.</p>
			
			<h4>The questionnaire</h4>
			<p>The questionnaire was delivered immediately after the game. Its primary goals were to identify the intuitiveness of the game's controls as well as player preferences.</p>
			<p>The questionnaire used numerical and liskert scales to determine the following for each of the game's two characters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The enjoyment of playing each character</li>
				<li>The ease of control with each character</li>
				<li>The frustration of the experience</li>
				<li>The ideal number of players desired in the game</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>Unfortunately, in the limited time available, a pilot test could not be conducted. A retrospective outlook notes the lack of questions related to player feedback</p>
			
			<p>Additional questions were asked for the following:</p>
			<ul>
			<li></li>

		<h2>Player evaluation: Discussion</h2>
		<h3>Sample and bias considerations</h3>
		<p>A noteworthy threat to the validity of the data was the sample size (N = 8). While the small sample size made the evaluation manageable in the short time available, the outliers of the quantitative data (from the Likert scales) could skew the responses.</p>
		<p>After their selection, the players had no opposition to the recording of the participants' screens with OBS, eliminating any selection bias between those who did or did not volunteer to record. However, there is likely to be selection bias resulting from the academic setting: both evaluations took place in the games academy studio, where the sample was chosen. This notably restricted the demographic to: academics, predominantly males, gamers, late teens/early 20's, and people with an overall greater understanding of the game development process than usual.</p>
		<p>In many ways, this sample is not representative of the casual playerbase which Critical Critters targets. Nonetheless, the input of academics with game development experience provides additional expertise which may aid the developer in creating solutions to discovered issues.</p>
		
		<h3>Question format</h3>
		<p>In addition to the generic character-based questions, the Homing Pigeon was granted two more questions, also in the form of Likert scales:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I found it easy to hit players</li>
			<li>I lit my fuse regularly</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The rationale behind these questions was to address subtleties in controlling the character. However, the uniqueness of the fuse ability made it impossible to compare with other abilities, devaluating it as a piece of data. The responses enabled the observer to understand whether the player lit their fuse, but not much more.</p>

		<h3>Improvements to the next evaluation</h3>
		<p>A future evaluation could be sent out to a wider audience to improve the precision of quantitative results and remove bias. Analysis of qualititative results would be harder, but could be aided with the adoption of different techniques, such as word clouds. Vitally, the questionnaire could be sent out to a wider, open audience with more varied demographic backgrounds, perhaps by distributing it on the Internet in a casual gaming hotspot.</p>
		<p>The pigeon-specific questions could be improved

		<h3>Player evaluation: Key takeaways</h3>
		<p>The results of the player evaluation resulted in the following key points:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Praise was broadly given to the ability to move around quickly</li>
		<li>Some praise was given to the ability to fly as the pigeon</li>
		<li>Difficulty was experienced in aiming</li>
		<li>Overall, the pigeon is less enjoyable to play</li>
		<li>Players who preferred the aesthetic of the pigeon enjoyed the overall experience less</li>
		<li>According to respondents, if the characters were designed optimally, the enjoyment of each character would be roughly well-balanced</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Due to the consistency of data that favoured the bunny over the pigeon, priority will be given to the improvement of the pigeon. An analysis of the heuristic evaluation results may help in finding specific solutions.</p>

		<h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
		<p>The heuristic evaluation results are collated into their respective categories. Each issue is ordered by priority and each evaluator is identified by a letter in brackets. The results are as follows:</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th>Heuristic</th>
				<th>Issues and Notes</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>A: Enduring Play<br/><i>Total severity points: 10</i></td>
				<td>3: Pidgeon gameplay leaves the player dead a lot of the time. Offset by interesting and fun gameplay and the short death timer. (A)<br />
				3: Gameplay can get repetitive/boring once most of the gameplay elements have been tested. (C)<br />
				2: Match times are quite long, could do with being half the time (B)<br />
				2: Having your death count go up when bombing as the pidgeon makes it feel like a punishment (B)
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>B: Variety of Game Players and Game Styles<br/><i>Total severity points: 6</i></td>
				<td>2: Asymmetric gameplay design is interesting but could be balanced better as pigeons inherently spend more time dead/respawning than the rabbits. (A)<br />
				2: More character types to play could allow for more game play style. Having a stealthy character for example. (B)<br />
				2: win state/Objective is not clear (C)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>C: Player's Perception of Control<br/><i>Total severity points: 8</i></td>
				<td>3: The pigeon controls are somewhat confusing at times, and the inability to hover or control speed of flying makes navigation hard. (A)<br />
				2: Bunny wall climbing sometimes doesn’t climb depending on where the camera is angled (B)<br />
				2: The bunny character is sometimes difficult to unstick from surfaces (C)<br />
				1: Camera being able to spin all the way vertically can be disorientating (B)</td>
				
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>D: Coolness/Entertainment<br/><i>Total severity points: 1</i></td>
				<td>1: Would like to see different maps available (B)<br /></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>E: Humor<br/><i>Total severity points: 3</i></td>
				<td>2: Potentially controversial depiction of “suicide bomber pigeons”. Otherwise, use of humour is very well executed. (A)
				1: All round in game humor is great, but could see the death notices getting a bit tiresome if played for a long period. (B)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>F: Immersion<br/><i>Total severity points: 12</i></td>
				<td>
				5: No audio, this could really bring the world together (B)<br />
				4: Lack of audio is the largest problem here, leaving the game feeling somewhat empty. (A)<br />
				2: Further graphical detail could help to add immersion, particularly less static scenery (moving grass/trees) (A)<br />
				1: it’s good enough (C)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>G: Documentation/Tutorial<br/><i>Total severity points: 16</i></td>
				<td>5: there is no tutorial or explanation on how to play (C)<br />
				4: No obvious tutorial or control explanation. Although the controls are fairly obvious to those familiar with the genre, there are several functions such as starting the pigeon timer that are difficult to figure out alone. (A)<br />
				4: It’s not clear that you can swap characters, I was only aware due to prior knowledge. (B)<br />
				3: No information on how the characters play, could do with a quick guide on both at the start. (B)<br />
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>H: Status and Score<br/><i>Total severity points: 1</i></td>
				<td>1: The controls are not fully consistent as the different characters have different controls, however their functions are similar enough that it is intuitive once the user understand what the controls are. (A)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>I: Game Provides Feedback<br/><i>Total severity points: 8</i></td>
				<td>5: Again a lack of audio lets the game down here (B)<br />
				3: Lack of audio feedback makes the game feel quite flat and unimmersive. The addition of sound effects, especially for weapon sounds, would greatly improve the feeling of excitement and interactivity. (A)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>J: Burden On Player<br/><i>Total severity points: 2</i></td>
				<td>2: The controls are not particularly easy to figure out, and the combat can be tricky, however the principles behind the game are very simple and easy to understand, allowing room to improve as the player’s skill level increases. (A)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>K: Screen Layout<br/><i>Total severity points: 6</i></td>
				<td>3: UI doesn’t exactly make sense, health just looks like a rainbow bar and not a health bar. Energy bar is understandable. (C)<br />
				2: The text channel output is somewhat small and a little hard to read. It’s positioning also distracts the player by making them look far from the centre of the screen when checking the killfeed. (A)<br />
				1: Scoreboard could be improved to look nicer and a bit more in tune with the wacky art style in the game (B)<br />
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>L: Error Prevention<br/><i>Total severity points: 5</i></td>
				<td>
				2: People with less experience with gaming may struggle to pick up and play without instructions on how the characters work and the game goals (B)<br />
				2: some elements of the levels get the bunny character stuck (C)<br />
				1: As there is no matchmaking, it is very possible for players to compete with much stronger or weaker players, however, the nature of the multiplayer means that it will most likely be groups of friends competing anyway. (A)<br />
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>M: Communication<br/><i>Total severity points: 4</i></td>
				<td>2: Chat text is slightly small, maybe should be positioned somewhere else, to be more visible instead at the bottom of the screen. Maybe it’s the colour of the text or that there is no text box wrapper. (C)<br />
				1: Good text communication, could be a little bigger/easy to read and could allow the player to scroll to view older messages. (A)<br />
				1: No voice chat but doesn’t feel needed really (B)<br /></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>N: Awareness<br/><i>Total severity points: 7</i></td>
				<td>
				3: players are quite small in scale compared to the world, so seeing someone from a distance is tricky (C)<br />
				3: Showing enemies’ health bars could prevent frustration from being unable to tell how close to death an enemy is and not knowing how much effect their attacks are having. (A)<br />
				1: It can be difficult to find other players sometimes, but this feels like it’s part of the game (B)<br />
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>O: Game play balance<br/><i>Total severity points: 12</i></td>
				<td>4: Severity of this issue depends largely on the intended interaction between teams. However, killing other pigeons when playing as a pigeon is very difficult, and killing pigeons as rabbits much harder than killing other rabbits. (A)<br />
				3: Shooting a flying pidegon as a bunny feels impossible (B)<br />
				3: as the rabbit it is quite difficult to shoot the pigeon (C)<br />
				2: Despite the power of the pigeons, their drawbacks mean that they do not feel too overpowered. (A)<br />

		<h3>Severity concerns</h3>
		<p>Based on (Fig. 1), the domains with the highest tallied severity points were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Documentation/Tutorial</li>
			<li>Game play balance</li>
			<li>Immersion</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Documentation/Tutorial</h3>
		<p>Documentation/Tutorial has overall collected the most severity points, primarily because the game provides no information on how to play or change characters (Fig. 1). This is noteworthy as an issue that could not have been discovered in the player evaluation, as that sample was introduced to the controls beforehand. The introduction of a tutorial in the game could help to mitigate confusion in the case that controls are not provided.</p>
		<p>This could be mitigated by <b>adding a tutorial to the early part of the game.</b></p>
		<p>The controls and abilities, in turn, can be displayed at any time when the player taps the F1 key.</p>
		<h3>Game play balance</h3>
		<p>Game play balance tied with Immersion for the most severity points. Three of the respondents confidently describe a difficulty killing the pigeon. However, one of them acknowledges that the pigeon's drawbacks make them feel not particularly overpowered (Fig. 1). This could be because the pigeon, indeed, kills itself as a core mechanic.</p>
		<p>As the results are unanimous, it is unreasonable to deny the difficulty in hitting a pigeon. An immediate solution may be to make the pigeon easier to hit, perhaps by increasing their hitbox, or making their TNT react to nearby electrical projectiles from the bunny.</p>
		<p>However, a (questionably-entitled) designer's perspective informs us that this may not strictly be an issue of balance in overall gameplay, but an issue of balance in the ability for the characters to hit each other. If, for example, it were made harder for pigeons to hit the bunnies, it could be a boost to heuristic B (variety of play styles), as players playing as the pigeon are allowed a more free-flowing, conflict-free gameplay that regardless grants them occasional opportunities to destroy bunnies. Further design discussions and player research could be conducted to ascertain the necessity of this change.</p>
		<p>An alternative, longer-term solution would be to add a new character that can counter the pigeon whilst not overpowering the bunny. An example of such a character that could be revived is the Tank Tortoise, a land-based, slow animal that is too slow to easily escape the bunnies, but has surface-to-air projectiles that can track and destroy pigeons. This could give the pigeon a viable threat. Implementing this character is a long-term goal, but not achievable in an adequately short time scale.</p>
		<h3>Immersion</h3>
		<p>The primary threat to immersion is the lack sound and music. This has been noted with severities of 5 and 4 in heuristic F (immersion) and a further 5 and 3 in heuristic I (game feedback) (Fig. 1), making the audio a high-scoring issue overall (total = 17).</p>
		<p>The simplest yet most resource-intensive solution is to create and add sounds and music into the game. Noting heuristic I's responses, sound effects could take precedence in order to provide additional player feedback, and music could follow to improve the immersion.</p>

		<h2>Player Evaluation</h2>
		<h3>Context</h3>
		<p>This evaluation was carried out on a small sample of players (N = 8), who had never played the game before. This took place in the games academy studio at Falmouth University. The small sample size made the interpretation of qualitative feedback manageable and brief; however, all data has been assumed as only preliminarily reliable, as the size of the sample is small enough for the margin of error to cover a wide area.</p>
		<h3>Character gameplay</h3>

		<span class="figure">Fig. 2: Player character experience</span>
		<p>The above are mean averages of a Likert scale depicting the players' opinions of four attributes of each character. Generally, the bunny character outperformed the pigeon character in most departments, noting that the first column is an inverted indicator of the player's quality of experience.</p>
		<h4>Frustration vs Control</h4>
		<p>One pitfall of the pigeon is an increased frustration with the character compared to the bunny as evidenced in (Fig 2). However, while the pigeon was reported to be easier to control, it was also reported to be significantly more frustrating to the player (Fig. 2). This could contradict an assumption that the frustration is due to difficult controls.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, despite the significantly higher reports of player frustration, the other attributes performed quite similarly between the pigeon and the bunny. That suggests that despite the allegedly more frustrating experience, the pigeon was still highly enjoyable to play.</p>

		<span class="figure">Fig. 3: Responses to open questions about the game. Pigeon-specific responses are <span style="color: aqua";>blue</span> whilst bunny-specific responses are <span style="color: yellow;">yellow.</span></span>
		<p>The reason for these paradoxes could be derived from the qualitative responses to the questionnaire's open question, asking <i>'What was your favourite part of the game?'</i>. The two pigeon-specific responses (in Fig. 3) both praise flying as an enjoyable ability. It is likely that the player's greater enjoyment of the Homing Pigeon stems from the excitement of being able to fly.</p>
		<p>This, combined with the description that the Homing Pigeon is easier to control, suggests that the controls are not responsible for the Homing Pigeon's lower performance in the mighty tall bar mountains of data justice. However, </p>
		<h4>Where is the frustration coming from?</h4>
		<p>The Homing Pigeon's primary means of attacking players is by crashing into them, with the pigeon exploding and dying in the process to fulfill its noble desTNTny. The following unfavourable responses in (Fig. 3) are therefore considered: <i>dying</i>, <i>killing yourself as the bir[d]</i>, and <i>attacking</i>. It would stand to reason that although it is the destiny of the pigeon to explode on impact, this process of dying in a self-inflicted manner could be frustrating to players, especially if they feel that the <i>spawning time</i> is too high, or that it is <i>difficult to aim</i> and <i>hard to hit other players</i> (Fig. 3).</p>
		<p>In the case of the Homing Pigeon, the main two challenges appear to be in <b>aiming</b> and <b>dying</b>. As exploding and dying is a fundamental part of the Homing Pigeon's noble destiny, the future development of the Homing Pigeon could instead dedicate toward improving the aiming process, and perhaps the spawn time. The heuristic evaluation could provide more insight on how the aiming process should be improved.</p>
		<h3>Character preferences</h3>
		<div style="text-align:center;"><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDNB7ushYH4_Ofcr1jcR3JpzWtAquF6U5OGpYDUz6CB8OViVdMZwsZH6G7ebx3hOMcWqJhdSlTWMvK/pubchart?oid=1135978605&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></div>
		<span class="figure">Fig. 4: Comparison of player character preferences based on certain traits</span>
		<p>The player's preferences for each character are roughly consistent with the findings in the previous section. Even the aesthetic of the bunny character was preferred. However, the pigeon performed more strongly in a hypothetical, idealised gameplay scenario wherein the character is designed perfectly. It is thus likely that, should the pigeon be easier to control, more powerful, or simply less frustrating, it could be an equally popular character. This creates a strong argument for improving this character in particular.</p>
		<h3>Bias in aesthetic</h3>
		<iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTDNB7ushYH4_Ofcr1jcR3JpzWtAquF6U5OGpYDUz6CB8OViVdMZwsZH6G7ebx3hOMcWqJhdSlTWMvK/pubchart?oid=2009854506&amp;format=interactive"></iframe>
		<span class="figure">Fig. 5: Comparison of player character aesthetic preferences with gameplay preferences</span>
		<p>A question raised during the assessment of the results was whether the <i>aesthetic</i> of a character could influence the player's preferences for the <i>gameplay</i> of that character. As illustrated above, there seems to be no positive correlation between a player's preference for a character's aesthetics and their gameplay. In fact, amusingly, players who preferred the aesthetic design of the <i>Pigeon</i> (38%) actually preferred the <i>Bunny's</i> gameplay, and even then, they appeared to enjoy the overall experience less. Contrastingly, players who preferred the aesthetic of the <i>Bunny</i> enjoyed both characters more.</p>
		<p>The sample size is arguably too small to derive a definitive answer. However, one hypothesis is that those who enjoyed the aesthetics of the pigeon played it more. As reported above, the pigeon character was overall less enjoyable to play. Therefore, the correlation could be a result of recall bias created from the reduced overall enjoyability experienced by these players as a result of playing the pigeon more frequently. This may have influenced their responses to both characters.</p>
		<p>For further research, the video footage of the players could be analysed to find the playtime of each character by the respondents. If a link exists between the aesthetic preferences of a character and the time spent playing that character, this could add further plausibility to the above hypothesis.</p>
		<h3>Ideal number of players</h3>
		<div style="margin: auto; text-align: center;"><img src="images/player_counts.png" alt="Player count preferences" width="300" /></div>
		<span class="figure">Fig. 5: Population of players who desired less (1) or more (5) players.</span>
		<p>Where 5 was described as "I want to see more players", whilst 1 was described as "I want to see less players", it is noted that all players in this sample wanted to see either more players in the game, or were neutral. The mean indicates only a marginal interest, although some outlying respondents were significantly certain that they wanted more players.</p>
		<p>There were eight players total in the gameplay session. The results (Fig. 5) suggest that the number of players could be increased for better enjoyability. This, however, is likely to be sensitive to factors such as the version of the game, number of characters available, maps and modes. Regardless, should the core gameplay remain relatively unchanged for this evaluation, a future evaluation could increase the player count. The amount by which to increase it is uncertain, as the question was deliberately non-specific; but it could be recursively tested until the player count which best satisfies the centre of this Likert scale is found: this will reveal the most popular player counts.</p>
		<p>It is marginally possible that this question was misinterpreted by some for an opinion on the overall popularity of the game. However, since the question, "How did you feel about the number of players?", was asked in past tense (indicating its applicability to the actual play session), this is unlikely.</p>
